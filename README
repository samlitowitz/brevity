SUMMARY: A simple web-site page handler. 

USAGE:   Install by copying all files your web documents directory.

To add a page to your website, create a file <action>.page.php in the ./pages directory. The name of your page will be used as part of the link, for example. A link to sample.page.php would be index.php?action=sample. 

You can then append extra arguments to pass as necessary. The sample page provided is a barebones example that can be modified however is necessary to meet your needs.  Toaccess extra arguments use $this->uGet['variable_name']. For example a path is index.php?action=sample&uid=124. To access the user identification inside your page class, use $this->uGet['uid']. With the exception of the 'action' variable, no arguments are filtered in any way. It is recommended you take steps to prevent code or SQL injection by filtering.
